# Rahner_final_project

Final project for WFSC data wrangling. Investigating tree growth climate relationships both above and below ground.

Data includes: tree ring data as well as daily temperature and precipitation data. Tree ring data comes from bandeleer national monument. Climate data comes from weather station XXXXXXX near bandeller national monument and was downloaded from Kilim explorer. Tree ring data are in .rwl files and temperature and precipitation are in excel spreadsheets.

In the sub directory there are 4 folders:

1.  data_clean: Data that is correctly structured for analysis. This includes the above and below ground chronologies, the daily temperature and precipitation data, and the precipitation data for the superposed epoch analysis.
2.  data_raw: Raw data that has not been processed for analysis. Contains raw ring width data and climate data.
3.  outputs: Plots made during analysis. This includes the above and below ground daily response to precipitation and temperature and the SEA plots.
4.  scripts: Code used for analysis, script: final_project.R is where all the code is for this project. Also in scripts in my final project proposal called: FinalProjectProposal.Rmd

For the analysis

1.  Clean up climate data
2.  Create daily comparisons between above and below ground chronologies to temperature and precipitation data.
3.  Run superposed epoch analysis to determine if different drought timing have most significant effect on tree growth.
