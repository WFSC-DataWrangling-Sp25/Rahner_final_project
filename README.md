# Rahner_final_project

Final project for WFSC data wrangling. Investigating tree growth climate relationships both above and below ground.

Data includes: tree ring .rwl files as well as daily temperature and precipitation data.

In the sub directory:

data_clean: Data that is correctly structured for analysis

data_raw: Raw data that has not been processed for analysis

outputs: figures and graphs made during analysis

scripts: code used for analysis, script: final_project is where all the code is for this project

For the analysis

1.  format climate data
2.  create daily comparisons between above and below ground chronologies and temperature and precipitation
3.  superposed epoch analysis to determine what periods of time have most significant effect on tree growth
